The control module extracts a first fault signal from the first FEC frame; generates a second fault signal based at least in part on the first fault signal; and encodes the second fault signal within a second FEC frame with the data traffic into a second digital data stream on the digital layer. The coherent transmitter has circuitry to convert the second digital data stream into a second optical signal on the optical layer and to transmit the second optical signal to a downstream node.},
