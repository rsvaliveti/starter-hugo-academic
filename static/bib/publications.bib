  abstract = {Accurate measurement and control for low-level transducer signals in metallurgical industry or laboratory is a complicated process. Until now, no measurement and control system was working truly at optimum cost and performance for a relatively small number of channels. A facility for remote and local data acquisition and process control applications in harsh metallurgical environments is presented in this paper. The system consists of a satellite microperipheral for interfacing between the ``real world'' and a host microcomputer. The satellite can operate far away from the host. Software and hardware aspects of this facility are presented. Metallurgical applications in four research projects ranging from laboratory tests to plant-scale tests are discussed.},

Since multiple symbols of the alphabet A reside on the same key, the representations of all the words in a finite dictionary H need not be unique. The problem is one of optimally assigning the symbols of the alphabet to the keys of a given keyboard with a view to minimize the total number of words that have ambiguous representation. The problem is proven to be NP-hard. After presenting the only reported solution to the problem, a fast learning-automaton-based solution to this problem is reported. Experimental results demonstrating the power of this solution are presented.<>},

In this paper, self-organizing linear list heuristics are examined under a more general query system which allows accesses to any subset of the list of elements. We propose a pragmatic model for the query generator, characterized by a set of parameters of size equal to the number of elements in the list. We derive the distribution of accesses to the individual records of the list, and show that these accesses are statistically dependent. Throughout this paper, the set accesses are processed by serializing the set elements.},

  abstract = {In several pattern recognition applications it is often necessary to approximate probability distributions/densities. In estimating this density function, it is either assumed that the form of the density function is known and that parameters that characterize the distribution are merely estimated, or it is assumed that no information about the density function is available. The latter formulation is considered with the additional constraint that even the stochastic dependence is unknown. For the case of discrete-valued features the well-known method due to Chow and Liu (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol.14, 462--467 (May 1968)) which uses dependence trees, can be used to approximate the underlying probability distribution. This method determines the best dependence-tree based on the well-acclaimed expected mutual information measure (EMIM) metric. The suitability of a chi-squared metric is studied for the same purpose. For a restricted class of distributions, both these metrics are shown to be equivalent and stochastically optimal. For more general cases, the latter metric is almost as efficient as the optimal one, and in all cases the technique presented here is computationally almost an order of magnitude faster than the EMIM based method.},

  abstract  = {A fundamental problem in information theory and pattern recognition involves computing and estimating the probability density function associated with a set of random variables. In estimating this density function, one can either assume that the form of the density function is known, and that we are merely estimating parameters that characterize the distribution or that no information about the density function is available. This problem has been extensively studied if the random variables are independent. If the random variables are dependent and are of the discrete sort, the problem of capturing this dependence between variables has been studied in Chow and Liu (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory14, 462--467 (May 1968)). The analogous problem for normally distributed continuous random variables has been tackled in Chow et al. (Comput. Biomed. Res.12, 589--613 (1979)). In both these instances, the determination of the best dependence tree hinges on the well-known Expected Mutual Information Measure (EMIM) Metric. Recently Valiveti and Oommen studied the suitability of the chi-squared based metric in-lieu of the EMIM metric, for the discrete variable case (Pattern Recognition25, 1389--1400 (1992)). In this paper, we generalize the latter result and study the use of the chi-squared metric for determining dependence trees for normally distributed random vectors. We show that for such vectors, the chi-squared metric yields the optimal tree and that it is identical to the one obtained using the EMIM metric. The computation of the maximum likelihood estimate of the dependence tree is also discussed.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we study the problem of maintaining a doubly-linked list (DLL) in approximately optimal order, with respect to the mean search time. We study two types of DLL reorganization strategies. Move-To-End (MTE) [12] and SWAP [14] are two memoryless DLL heuristics obtained from natural extensions of the well-known singly-linked-list (SLL) heuristics, move-to-front and transposition, respectively. We first derive a general sufficient condition which permits comparison of any two DLL heuristics. We use this condition as a guideline to identify families of access distributions for which SWAP yields a lower expected cost than the MTE. We have also presented an absorbing DLL heuristic. The strategy requires one additional memory location and is analogous to the scheme presented in [15]. The reorganization is achieved by moving each element exactly once to its final position in the reorganized list. The scheme is stochastically absorbing and it is shown to be optimal for a restricted family of distributions. Thus, for these distributions, the probability of the scheme converging to the optimal list order can be made as close to unity as desired.},
