 abstract = {A method of executing in-session encryption verification includes receiving a plurality of client data packets for transmission through a network; receiving one or more test data packets for verifying an encryption device; merging the client data packets and the one or more test packets into a data stream; selecting security parameters for each packet in the data stream based on a corresponding packet type; encrypting each packet in the data stream using the encryption device and the corresponding security parameters; and transmitting the data stream comprising encrypted packets through the network. The method also includes decrypting the encrypted packets at a receiving system using congruent techniques.},
