abstract: A method of executing in-session encryption verification includes receiving
  a plurality of client data packets for transmission through a network; receiving
  one or more test data packets for verifying an encryption device; merging the client
  data packets and the one or more test packets into a data stream; selecting security
  parameters for each packet in the data stream based on a corresponding packet type;
  encrypting each packet in the data stream using the encryption device and the corresponding
  security parameters; and transmitting the data stream comprising encrypted packets
  through the network. The method also includes decrypting the encrypted packets at
  a receiving system using congruent techniques.
