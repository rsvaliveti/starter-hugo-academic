abstract: A regen node is described. The regen node includes a coherent receiver,
  a control module and a coherent transmitter. The coherent receiver has circuitry
  to convert a first optical signal received from an upstream node in an optical layer
  of an optical network to a first digital data stream in a digital layer having a
  first FEC frame and a data traffic. The control module extracts a first fault signal
  from the first FEC frame; generates a second fault signal based at least in part
  on the first fault signal; and encodes the second fault signal within a second FEC
  frame with the data traffic into a second digital data stream on the digital layer.
  The coherent transmitter has circuitry to convert the second digital data stream
  into a second optical signal on the optical layer and to transmit the second optical
  signal to a downstream node.
