abstract: Accurate measurement and control for low-level transducer signals in metallurgical
  industry or laboratory is a complicated process. Until now, no measurement and control
  system was working truly at optimum cost and performance for a relatively small
  number of channels. A facility for remote and local data acquisition and process
  control applications in harsh metallurgical environments is presented in this paper.
  The system consists of a satellite microperipheral for interfacing between the ``real
  world'' and a host microcomputer. The satellite can operate far away from the host.
  Software and hardware aspects of this facility are presented. Metallurgical applications
  in four research projects ranging from laboratory tests to plant-scale tests are
  discussed.
