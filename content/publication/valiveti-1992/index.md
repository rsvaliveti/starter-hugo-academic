abstract: In several pattern recognition applications it is often necessary to approximate
  probability distributions/densities. In estimating this density function, it is
  either assumed that the form of the density function is known and that parameters
  that characterize the distribution are merely estimated, or it is assumed that no
  information about the density function is available. The latter formulation is considered
  with the additional constraint that even the stochastic dependence is unknown. For
  the case of discrete-valued features the well-known method due to Chow and Liu (IEEE
  Trans. Inf. Theory, vol.14, 462--467 (May 1968)) which uses dependence trees, can
  be used to approximate the underlying probability distribution. This method determines
  the best dependence-tree based on the well-acclaimed expected mutual information
  measure (EMIM) metric. The suitability of a chi-squared metric is studied for the
  same purpose. For a restricted class of distributions, both these metrics are shown
  to be equivalent and stochastically optimal. For more general cases, the latter
  metric is almost as efficient as the optimal one, and in all cases the technique
  presented here is computationally almost an order of magnitude faster than the EMIM
  based method.
