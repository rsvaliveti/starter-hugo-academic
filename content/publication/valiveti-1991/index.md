abstract: The problem of reorganizing a linear list, when the individual records are
  accessed independently, has been well studied. In this paper, self-organizing linear
  list heuristics are examined under a more general query system which allows accesses
  to any subset of the list of elements. We propose a pragmatic model for the query
  generator, characterized by a set of parameters of size equal to the number of elements
  in the list. We derive the distribution of accesses to the individual records of
  the list, and show that these accesses are statistically dependent. Throughout this
  paper, the set accesses are processed by serializing the set elements.
