abstract: 'A method includes receiving client data; extracting overhead data from
  the client data;  mapping the client data into one or more frames, where each of
  the one or more frames has a  frame payload section and a frame overhead section,
  where the client data is mapped into the  one or more frames; inserting the overhead
  data into the frame overhead section of the one or  more frames; transporting the
  one or more frames across a network by generating a plurality of  optical subcarriers
  carrying the one or more frames; extracting the overhead data from the frame  overhead
  section of the one or more frames; recovering the client data from the one or more  frames;
  inserting the extracted overhead data into the recovered client data to create modified  client
  data; and outputting the modified client data. '
