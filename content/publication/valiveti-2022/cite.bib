 abstract = {A method includes receiving client data; extracting overhead data from the client data; 
mapping the client data into one or more frames, where each of the one or more frames has a 
frame payload section and a frame overhead section, where the client data is mapped into the 
one or more frames; inserting the overhead data into the frame overhead section of the one or 
more frames; transporting the one or more frames across a network by generating a plurality of 
optical subcarriers carrying the one or more frames; extracting the overhead data from the frame 
overhead section of the one or more frames; recovering the client data from the one or more 
frames; inserting the extracted overhead data into the recovered client data to create modified 
client data; and outputting the modified client data. },
